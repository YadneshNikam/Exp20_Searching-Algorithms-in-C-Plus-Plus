# Exp20_Searching-Algorithms-in-C-Plus-Plus
### Aim  
To study and implement searching algorithms.

### Software Required  
Visual Studio.

### Theory  
Searching algorithms are used to find specific items in a collection of data. Two common algorithms based on array type are:

- **Linear Search**: Used for unsorted arrays. It sequentially compares each element with the target until found or all elements are checked. It has a time complexity of O(n) and works for both sorted and unsorted data.

- **Binary Search**: Used for sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half by comparing the middle element with the target, narrowing down the search space. It is faster than linear search with a time complexity of O(log n).

### Implementation  
Two programs demonstrate these techniques in C++:  
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search  

### Conclusion  
The codes illustrate the concept and implementation of linear and binary search algorithms in C++, providing effective methods for searching in various data scenarios.
